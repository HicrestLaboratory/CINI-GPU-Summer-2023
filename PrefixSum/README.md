# Prefix Sum

The code could be launched with the following command line:

```
PrefixSum n v
```

The parameter _n_ define the problem size: the vector on which the prefix sum is performed has dimension 2^n.

If you wanna print all the involved vectors, you can set the verbose parameter _'v'_ as 1, otherwise, it must be 0.
